## Bikesharing using NYC CitiBike data set

## Project Overview

The intention of this project is to analyze Citi Bike Data bike-sharing data from August 2019 in order to help build a solid business proposal for a similar program in Des Moines. One of the key stakeholders interested in this project would like to see a bike trip analysis. 

This analysis used Pandas in order to change the trip duration column from integer to datetime datatype. Once this datatype was converted, a set of visualizations were created in order to:
- Show the lenhth of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
